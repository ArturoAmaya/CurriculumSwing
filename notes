Double check what happens when you run the recursive section of the minimizer - just got some results that didnt add up, i.e. I was implicitly choosing origin 0 and there was already a course in there but the recursive solution had a course in origin 0 (which would make for a merged total of three, which currently makes no sense)
(Solved, was using the wrong index for minimizer recursion result merging)
